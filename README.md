# Project-on-quick-implementation-of-NLP-libraries
The project is aimed at scraping the English reviews on the Russian metro within the Tripadvisor website, 
the graphic representation of obtained results as well as the quick implementation of three NLP-libraries (TextBlob, NLTK, Flair), 
which were used for the small sentimental analysis. It was quite interesting to demonstrate the specific accuracy of the above-mentioned NLP-libraries, 
while comparing their sentimental (negative or positive) outcomes with the valid review grades of people (scale 1-5), where grades 1-2 represented negative sentiments, 
and grades 3-5 represented positive sentiments.
